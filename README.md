# For Copywriters: Installing the Cell Metadata Manager

## What This Add-in Does

Lets you attach hidden information to table cells:
- **Link** - URLs for text links
- **References** - Medical publication citations  
- **Alt Tags** - Image alternative text
- **Functionality** - Behavior notes

The main content stays clean - supportive info is hidden in a side panel!

## Installation (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get the Manifest File

Your manager will send you a file called `manifest.xml`. Save it somewhere you can find it.

### Step 2: Open Microsoft Word

Open Word on your Mac or Windows computer.

### Step 3: Install the Add-in

1. Click **Insert** in the top menu
2. Click **Get Add-ins** (or "Office Add-ins")
3. Click **MY ADD-INS** at the top
4. Click **Upload My Add-in** at the bottom
5. Click **Browse** and find the `manifest.xml` file
6. Click **Upload**

You'll see a success message!

### Step 4: Find the Add-in

1. Look at the **Home** tab in Word's ribbon
2. Find the **Cell Metadata** section
3. Click **Show Metadata Panel**
4. A panel opens on the right side!

## How to Use It

### Adding Metadata to a Cell

1. Click on any cell in your table
2. Make sure the metadata panel is open (see Step 4 above)
3. Fill in the fields you need:
   - Link (URL)
   - References (citations)
   - Alt Tags (for images)
   - Functionality (notes)
4. Click **Save Metadata**
5. Done! The cell now has a subtle box around it

### Loading Metadata from a Cell

1. Click on a cell that has metadata (you'll see a subtle box)
2. In the metadata panel, click **Load Metadata**
3. All the info appears in the fields
4. Copy what you need!

### Clearing Metadata

1. Click on a cell with metadata
2. Click **Clear Metadata** in the panel
3. Confirm when asked

## Tips

- **Can't see the panel?** Click "Show Metadata Panel" in the Home tab
- **Cell has no metadata?** You'll see "No metadata found" when you click Load
- **Metadata travels with the document** - save the Word file to keep your metadata
- **Designers won't see the metadata** - just the main content (which is the point!)

## Troubleshooting

### Add-in doesn't appear after installation
- Close ALL Word windows
- Open Word again
- Check the Home tab ribbon

### Can't upload manifest
- Make sure the file is named exactly `manifest.xml`
- Try saving it to your Desktop first
- Make sure you have the latest version from your manager

### Panel won't open
- Try clicking "Show Metadata Panel" again
- Restart Word
- Contact your manager for help

## Need Help?

Ask your manager or the person who sent you the manifest file!
